To test:
1. Run make clean.
2. Run make.
** Make sure ckpt module is loaded.
3. Run ./ck.x
4. Run ./res.x

Expected results:
1. Here, we checkpoint the process making the ioctl call to
checkpoint.
$>./ck.x
$> Before ckpt.
$> Process killed.

2. Here, we restart the process started by checkpoint.
$>./res.x
$> Restarting...
$> After checkpoint.

Current actual results:
1. 
$>./ck.x
$> Before ckpt.
$> Process killed.

2. 
$>./res.x
$> Restarting...
$> Segmentation fault.
